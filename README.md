# SoftwareDesignDocument

*Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The gaming room client helps setting up a web-based verision of the gaming Win, Lose or Draw, requiring contestants to guess what is being drawn, the software requirements include;
    1)game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
    2)ch team will have multiple players assigned to it.
    3)me and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
    4)one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
    THey are asking us to prepare a software design document that helps with developing the game application.
*What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I thought I had the presentation and all the components adequately lableed and explained. I thought I had a good emphasis to explaing to the gaming room the different types of OS systems and the various pros/cons of each.
*What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
      I thought it helped to give insignt on exaclty what we need, especially the UML diagram which helps lay a template for how the code will be set up. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I would change some of my design constraints as I felt those may have been some of the weaker components of my design document 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  We looked at the software requirements, and tailored them to the needs of the users playting the game. The needs of the users are important because they are the feedback to decide which components of our game application need tweaking or keeping.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
I approahced each answer one by one and helped to tie them together to lead me through the document and coding. I think the UML diagram helped me immensely and will be using those in the future again.
